Since refine is a versatile framework designed for building all types of CRUD apps, such as *internal tools*, *admin panels*, *B2B apps*, and *dashboards*, this tutorial will focus on showcasing how refine simplifies the development process of creating a minimal yet fully functional admin panel app. 
 
 You will be guided through the process of building a CRUD app, including authentication, CRUD operation components, and fully functional pages, all built using the **refine** framework

You can take a look at the similar app that we'll be constructing in this tutorial by following this [link](https://refine.new/preview/a4f6eb83-2dd7-453b-b26a-4d3f48eeb543).






**We'll cover the following topics:**

-   Setting up your development environment.
-   Creating your first **refine** app.
-   Communicate with your API through [`dataProvider`](/docs/api-reference/core/providers/data-provider/).
-   The concept of the [`resources`](docs/api-reference/core/components/refine-config.md#resources) property.
-   Adding CRUD pages to your project.
-   Handle authentication with [`authProvider`](https://refine.dev/docs/tutorial/understanding-authprovider/index/).


You will learn all the necessary steps to get started with **refine**, from setting up your development environment to launching your app. üöÄ
